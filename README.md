# Solvaxo
Solvaxo is a very fast and efficient sudoku solver. It's based on backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

## Technologies used
* C++
* Catch2 - for testing purpose
* Backtracking algorithm
